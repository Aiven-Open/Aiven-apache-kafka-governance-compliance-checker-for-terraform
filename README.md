# Usage
This program can be used for example in a GitHub Action to indicate if the 
plan generated by terraform complies with aiven terraform provider resources.

The plan is to have the GitHub action that wraps this code shared privately with customer repository,
which they can then choose to use as a validation step in their pipeline.
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/sharing-actions-and-workflows-from-your-private-repository#about-github-actions-access-to-private-repositories

If we ever decide to make this repository public it could be published in
the github marketplace for wider audience.

# TODO

# How to run
```bash
terraform plan -out="./plan"
