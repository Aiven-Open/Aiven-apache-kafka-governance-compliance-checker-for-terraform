# aiven-terraform-governance-compliance-checker
GitHub Action to check whether the plan generated by terraform plan complies with governance rules on aiven terraform provider resources.

# How it works
When a pull request is opened, the action will generate the plan using `terraform plan` and analyze the output to see
whether the user requesting the change is is a member of the owner group and whether the pull request has been approved by a member of the owner group.

For example:
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "error": "requesting user is not a member of the owner group",
      "address": "aiven_kafka_topic.foo"
    },
    {
      "error": "approval required from a member of the owner group",
      "address": "aiven_kafka_topic.foo"
    }
  ] 
}
```


# Setup
Here is how to set it up for your repository:
1. For the action to understand who is who, you'll need to map the github login username to aiven internal user using the `aiven_external_identity` data resource. For example:
```
data "aiven_external_identity" "foo" {
  organization_id = data.aiven_organization_user.organization_id,
  internal_user_id = data.aiven_organization_user.user_id,
  external_user_id = "github-username",
  external_service_name = "github"
}
```

2. The action only considers topics with owner, which you can define using `aiven_kafka_topic.owner_user_group_id`. For example:
```
resource "aiven_kafka_topic" "foo" {
  topic_name = "foo"
  owner_user_group_id = aiven_organization_user_group.foo.group_id
  ...
}
```

3. Finally, use the github action in your `.github/workflows`. For example:
```yaml
name: 'Aiven Terraform Governance Compliance Check'

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
      - labeled
      - unlabeled

  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, dismissed, edited]

jobs:
  aiven_terraform_governance_compliance_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        - name: "Aiven Terraform Governance Compliance Check Test"
          id: "compliance-check"
          uses: aiven/aiven_terraform_governance_compliance_check
          with:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            AIVEN_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AIVEN_API_TOKEN }}
        - run: |
            if [ $(echo ${{ steps.compliance-check.outputs.result }} | jq '.ok') == "true" ]
                then
                    echo "OK"
                else
                    echo $RESULT | jq
                    exit 1
                fi
```
